**Online Boutique** is a cloud-first microservices demo application.  
Online Boutique consists of an 10-tier microservices application. The application is a web-based e-commerce app where items can be browsed, added to the cart, and purchased.

This application was developed to demonstrate the use of AWS technologies such as Kubernetes, Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS), AWS App Mesh, Amazon CloudWatch, and gRPC. It works on any Kubernetes cluster, including Amazon EKS.  
The application is easy to deploy with little to no configuration.
